# Scratch Org Pooling Part 2 \(prepare\)

### **Learning Objectives**

* Why is scratch org pooling important in continuous integration? 
* What is the prepare command? 
* How do I use the prepare command? 

**Time to complete:** 30 minutes

### Prepare Command

The prepare command, which is apart of the orchestrator functionality of sfpowerscripts was introduced in 2020 and provides scratch org pooling, specifically tailored for use in your CICD platform. 

Prepare command helps you to build a pool of prebuilt scratch orgs which include managed packages as well as packages in your repository. This process allows you to considerably cut down time in re-creating a scratch org during validation process when a scratch org is used as Just-in-time CI environment.

#### GitHub Actions 

We will be using GitHub Actions paired with Yaml to create our CICD files. For more information on these, we recommend the following: 

* [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions) 
* [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/templates?view=azure-devops ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema%2Cparameter-schema)

While this last article is related to Azure Pipelines, the concepts are relatively universal and can be applied to GitHub Actions. 

### Steps

Good news! If you completed [Scratch Org Pooling Part 1](scratch-org-pooling.md) you have already completed the installation steps required. If you haven't, go back to this module and follow the instructions under the steps '**Install the prerequisite fields'**. 

#### Fork the 'Easy Spaces' Repo 

* For the repo located at [https://github.com/trailheadapps/easy-spaces-lwc](https://github.com/trailheadapps/easy-spaces-lwc)
* Delete all files located under ./github, ./github/workflows and ./github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE 

#### Create a 'prepare' file 

* Click on 'Actions' in the newly forked repo

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2843%29.png)

* Create a new workflow and name it 'prepare'
* Replace the contents of the file with the file below 

```text
# Unique name for this workflow
name: sfpowerscripts prepare

# Definition when the workflow should run
on:
    workflow_dispatch:
    schedule:
        - cron: '0 0 * * *'

# Jobs to be executed
jobs:
    prepare:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        container: dxatscale/sfpowerscripts
        steps:
            # Checkout the code in the pull request
            - name: 'Checkout source code'
              uses: actions/checkout@v2
              with:
                  ref: master

            # Authenticate dev hub
            - name: 'Authenticate Dev Hub'
              run: |
                  sfdx auth:jwt:grant -u ${{ secrets.DEVHUB_USERNAME }} -i ${{ secrets.DEVHUB_CLIENT_ID }} -f ./JWT_KEYFILE -a devhub -r https://login.salesforce.com
              env:
                  SALESFORCE_JWT_SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEVHUB_SERVER_KEY }}

            # Prepare a pool of scratch orgs
            - name: 'Prepare a pool of scratch orgs'
              run: 'sfdx sfpowerscripts:orchestrator:prepare -t preparepool -v devhub --installall -m 3 --succeedondeploymenterrors' 
```

What is this file doing? Let's have a look. 

**First**, it's given a name 'sfpowerscripts prepare' 

**Secondly**, it's given a time schedule on which to run. This schedule is set to run every day at midnight. 

**Thirdly** it is given a list of steps to execute in a specific order. These steps are are: 

1. Checkout the source code of your project, on branch 'master'. If you would prefer a different branch checked out, supply this branch in the 'ref' section
2. Authenticate the DevHub using JWT flow, [more information on JWT flow](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_jwt_flow.htm%20)
3. Execute the 'prepare' command 

#### Add GitHub Secrets 

Notice in the code above, there are 'secrets' in the authentication task. Secrets are GitHub Action's way of hiding variables within your code, in this case your yaml file. More information on secrets can be found here: [https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets\#:~:text=The%20secrets%20that%20you%20create,use%20them%20in%20a%20workflow.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#:~:text=The%20secrets%20that%20you%20create,use%20them%20in%20a%20workflow.)

Let's set up the secrets we need.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is recommended to set up a new trailhead playground with DevHub and Unlocked packages enabled for the Orchestrator modules. 
{% endhint %}

**First**, if you haven't previously, you will need to set up a JWT flow. We will not explicitly cover this subject, as the instructions are located here: [https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx\_dev.meta/sfdx\_dev/sfdx\_dev\_auth\_jwt\_flow.htm\#sfdx\_dev\_auth\_jwt\_flow](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_auth_jwt_flow.htm#sfdx_dev_auth_jwt_flow) under the topic heading 'Authorize an Org Using the JWT Bearer Flow'. 

* Go to your GitHub repository and select 'Settings' 

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2838%29.png)

* Now select 'Secrets' 

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2837%29.png)

* Select 'New repository secret' 

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2834%29%20%281%29.png)

* Add your DevHub login username as a 'secret' value with the name DEVHUB\_USERNAME

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2832%29.png)

* Navigate to the Connected App you created in setting up the JWT flow and copy the 'Consumer Key'

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2835%29%20%281%29%20%282%29.png)

* Add this consumer key as a 'secret' value with the name DEVHUB\_CLIENT\_ID
* Now open the 'server.key' file you created when setting up the JWT flow and add the entire contents of the file as a 'secret' value with the name DEVHUB\_SERVER\_KEY 

#### Run your workflow

* Go back to actions and select the workflow 

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2841%29.png)

* Run the workflow by selecting 'run workflow' 

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2842%29.png)

* Select the job to watch it running through the tasks and create the scratch orgs required

### Recap

Congratulations! You have just created a scratch org pool specifically for use in your CICD workflow! You have also learned about GitHub actions and are on your way to being a CI/CD Master.
